# zoltr - An R client for the Zoltar data repository API

## Overview

This package contains functions for working with the
[Zoltar](https://www.zoltardata.com/) forecast repository’s API,
including projects, models, forecasts, and truth. Read more about this
package at the [zoltr pkgdown site](http://reichlab.io/zoltr/).
Documentation on Zolar itself is at
[docs.zoltardata.com](https://docs.zoltardata.com/).

## Installation

You can install the released version of zoltr from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("zoltr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reichlab/zoltr")
```

> Note: Due to the rapid pace of zoltr development, CRAN version lags
> behind development. We highly suggest you install the development
> version to get the latest features.

## Getting started

For those starting out we recommend you begin with the [Getting Started
vignette](articles/getting-started.html).

## Usage

Read more at the [zoltr pkgdown site](http://reichlab.io/zoltr/), but
briefly you use the `new_connection()` function to create a connection
to [Zoltar](https://www.zoltardata.com/) and then pass that connection
along with the *URL* of the resource of interest (e.g., a project,
model, or forecast) to this package’s various functions like
`projects()` or `project_info()`.

``` r
library(zoltr)
zoltar_connection <- new_connection()
zoltar_authenticate(zoltar_connection, Sys.getenv("Z_USERNAME"), Sys.getenv("Z_PASSWORD"))
zoltar_connection
#> ZoltarConnection 'https://zoltardata.com' authenticated (exp=2024-04-08 13:29:49 UTC)

the_projects <- projects(zoltar_connection)
project_url <- the_projects[the_projects$name == "Docs Example Project", "url"]
the_project_info <- project_info(zoltar_connection, project_url)
names(the_project_info)
#>  [1] "id"           "url"          "owner"        "is_public"    "name"        
#>  [6] "description"  "home_url"     "logo_url"     "core_data"    "truth"       
#> [11] "model_owners" "models"       "units"        "targets"      "timezeros"
the_project_info$name
#> [1] "Docs Example Project"
```

## Forecast data format

The native forecast data format supported by the Zoltar API is a `list`.
See [docs.zoltardata.com](https://docs.zoltardata.com/) for format
details. You can find an example at vignettes/docs-predictions.json . By
convention this package referred to this as `forecast_data`. This
package supports conversion to this format (which is used throughout the
package) from the CDC’s CSV file format \[1\] via the
`forecast_data_from_cdc_csv_file`() function. Future versions will
support bidirectional conversion, as well as support for a more general
CSV format.

\[1\] Details about the CDC CSV format can be found at
